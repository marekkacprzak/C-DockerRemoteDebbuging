# Project Title

This project is a sample console application designed for remote debugging without the need to download a debugger from the internet.

## Description

The application runs a never-ending loop, providing the ability to attach a debugger to the running process at any time. This is particularly useful for diagnosing issues that occur over extended periods of runtime.

## Debugging

The application is configured to communicate with a remote debugger through port 5000. This allows for real-time debugging of the application as it runs in its environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the application
3. Run the application
4. Attach your debugger to the running process on port 5000 (vscode .NET Core Docker Attach)

Please note that this is a sample project and may require additional configuration to work in your specific environment.
